First and foremost, acknowledge how far you've already come \u2013 having Python and JavaScript skills under your belt is a fantastic start. Now, let's focus on what to learn next.\n\nConsidering your interests in AI and Web Development, I'd recommend prioritizing the skills related to AI for now. Given your current Python skills, I think it's essential to dive deeper into the AI/ML world. Focus on mastering NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These libraries are fundamental to working with data in AI and ML. Once you feel comfortable with these, you can move on to scikit-learn for traditional ML and then progress to deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch. Remember, it's a 12-18 month timeline to establish a solid foundation in AI/ML, but with consistent effort, you'll be well on your way.\n\nTo get started, I suggest dedicating a few hours each day or a few days each week to learning new concepts. For example, you could:\n\n1. Spend 2 hours today learning about NumPy and Pandas through online tutorials or YouTube videos.\n2. Allocate 2-3 days to complete a Kaggle competition project that involves using scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch.\n3. Review your schedule for the week ahead and block out dedicated time to practice coding exercises and projects related to AI/ML.\n\nKeep in mind that practice and hands-on experience are crucial to mastering these skills. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things \u2013 it's all part of the learning process.

You've already got a solid foundation in Python and JavaScript, and you're interested in both AI and web development - that's a great combination of skills to have. \n\nConsidering your current knowledge, I would suggest focusing on building a solid foundation in one area first. Since you're interested in AI, I would recommend diving deeper into AI/ML skills development. The path I outlined earlier, which involves learning Python deeply, mastering NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and progressing to deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch, is a great place to start. This will take around 12-18 months to complete, but trust me, it'll be worth it.\n\nAs you progress in AI/ML skills development, you can also experiment with web development on the side. You don't necessarily need to wait until you've completed the AI/ML path before starting to learn web development. You can start by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and then eventually, move on to frameworks like React or Vue for the frontend, and Node.js or Python for the backend. Remember, the key is to build strong projects and deploy them to showcase your work, so be sure to practice by building real projects.\n\nHere are two concrete next steps to consider:\n1. Set a specific goal for the next 3-6 months, such as completing a Kaggle competition or building a simple AI/ML project, and create a plan to achieve that goal.\n2. Start learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and experiment with building a simple web application to get a feel for web development.\nAnd, most importantly, don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance along the way. There are many online resources and communities available to support you in your learning journey. Keep in mind that learning is a lifelong process, and it's okay to take your time and focus on building a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.
